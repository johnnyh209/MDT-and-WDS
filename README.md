# MDT-and-WDS

Now that I have gotten my feet wet with using Windows Deployment Services (WDS), I wanted to try including Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) as well. This weill be my first time using MDT, where my goal is to create a bootable image/iso of Windows 10 that I will deploy using PXE boot. All of this is done in virtual machines using Hyper-V.
